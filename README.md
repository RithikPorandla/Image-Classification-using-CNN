## Fashion MNIST Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This Python script demonstrates the training and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying Fashion MNIST images. The Fashion MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of clothing items belonging to 10 different categories. 

### Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow (Keras API)

### Description:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded using the TensorFlow Keras API. The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1] and reshaped to include a channel dimension for grayscale images.
- **Data Augmentation**: ImageDataGenerator from Keras is used for data augmentation, which includes random rotations, shifts, shears, zooms, and flips. This helps improve the generalization of the model and reduce overfitting.
- **Model Architecture**: The CNN model consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction and spatial downsampling. Dropout regularization is applied to reduce overfitting. The final layer uses softmax activation for multiclass classification.
- **Model Training**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. ModelCheckpoint callback is used to save the best model based on validation accuracy during training. The model is trained for 20 epochs with augmented data.
- **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to calculate the accuracy.
- **Model Inference**: The best model (based on validation accuracy) is loaded, and predictions are made on a few test samples. Predicted labels are compared with true labels, and sample images with their true and predicted labels are displayed using matplotlib.

### How to Use:
1. Run the script to train the CNN model and evaluate its performance on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. The best model checkpoint ('best_model.h5') will be saved during training.
3. Predictions on a few test samples are displayed after loading the best model.
